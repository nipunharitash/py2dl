	This program takes a mantra of your choice and 
    recites ** (saves as a text file) 1008 Times for each rotation of the wheel. You will specify 
    the number of times you want to turn the wheel. The text file with recited mantra in multiples 
    of 1008 is saved in the current directory as MantraChant.txt. Avoid specifying excessively big
    number in turns as it may result in an excessively large file being produced.
